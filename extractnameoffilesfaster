#os.scandir only works for python versions after 3.5
#os.scandir returns an iterator instead of a list when used
#os.scandir  loops over the contents of the iterator and prints out the filenames
# "with" i.e. using the function os.scandir... then enter file path/directory... as 
with os.scandir('C:/Users/modul/Desktop/Allfiles/') as entries:
	for entry in entries:
		print(entry.name)
